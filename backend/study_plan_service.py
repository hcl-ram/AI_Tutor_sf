Make the study plan:
- Highly personalized based on their specific topics and preferences
- Realistic and achievable given their timeline
- Detailed enough to be immediately actionable
- Educational and comprehensive for exam preparation
- Focused on their specific subject and grade level

Generate content that is specific to the topics they mentioned, not generic. For example, if they're studying "Laws of Inertia" in Physics, provide real physics content about Newton's laws, not generic study advice.
